        The startup aims to address key challenges in the food supply chain by empowering farmers and
        providing consumers with access to fresh, healthy produce. One major issue is the unfair pricing
        faced by farmers due to the involvement of numerous middlemen who dictate the rates at which crops
        are bought and sold. To solve this, the startup creates a direct-to-consumer (D2C) platform that
        enables farmers to bypass intermediaries and sell their produce directly to consumers, allowing them
        to secure better prices and reduce costs.

        In urban areas, many people struggle to access fresh, unadulterated food due to preservatives and long
        supply chains. The startup resolves this by offering consumers a platform that connects them directly
        to farmers, ensuring healthier, fresher food options. Furthermore, a lack of transparency in the food
        supply chain affects all stakeholders, from farmers to retailers and consumers. To tackle this, the
        startup offers a mobile application that tracks and provides transparency about the origin and production
        process of food, fostering trust and sustainability in the supply chain.
